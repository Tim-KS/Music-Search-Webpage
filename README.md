# Music Brain

Music Brain is an online tool that all music enthusiasts can get on board with. Finding out more about your favourite artist can be a chore as there is information all over the place and usually you have to scroll and read through paragraph after paragraph. What if you could get all the information you needed, all in one place just at the touch of a button? That's exactly what music brain is for.

Music brain is a centralised area where our user can search up their artist of choice. It will then output a quick paragraph about the artist, a picture of them, their top 5 songs with built in YouTube videos to be able to listen to them. No more visiting 50 different websites just to find out some more about your favourite artist.
